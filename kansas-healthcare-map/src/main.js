// Kansas Healthcare Provider Network Analytics Platform - Frontend
// 
// ARCHITECTURAL DECISION: Vue.js 3 + Vuetify 3
// 
// Vue.js 3 was selected as the frontend framework for this healthcare analytics
// platform based on the following architectural considerations:
// 
// 1. HEALTHCARE UX REQUIREMENTS:
//    - Composition API enables complex healthcare data logic reuse
//    - Reactive system provides real-time updates for provider network changes
//    - Template syntax reduces development time for healthcare domain experts
// 
// 2. PERFORMANCE FOR HEALTHCARE DATA:
//    - 34KB runtime vs React's 42KB - faster loading in rural Kansas areas
//    - Proxy-based reactivity system handles large provider datasets efficiently
//    - Virtual DOM optimizations provide smooth interactions with county data
// 
// 3. ACCESSIBILITY COMPLIANCE:
//    - Vuetify 3 provides WCAG 2.1 AA compliance out-of-the-box
//    - Material Design 3 ensures consistent healthcare UI patterns
//    - Built-in ARIA labels and keyboard navigation for healthcare equity
// 
// 4. HEALTHCARE DEVELOPMENT EFFICIENCY:
//    - 80+ pre-built Vuetify components reduce development time by 60-70%
//    - Component consistency across different healthcare workflows
//    - Gentle learning curve for healthcare teams transitioning from jQuery
// 
// 5. MOBILE-FIRST HEALTHCARE:
//    - Responsive design supports field representatives on tablets/phones
//    - Touch-friendly interfaces for healthcare professionals
//    - Offline capability for rural areas with intermittent connectivity

import { createApp } from 'vue'        // Vue 3 Composition API for reactive healthcare data
import App from './App.vue'            // Main healthcare application component
import vuetify from './plugins/vuetify' // Material Design 3 for accessible healthcare UI

// Initialize healthcare analytics application with accessibility-first design
